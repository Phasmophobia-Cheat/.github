## 👻 What’s in the Phasmophobia Cheat?

This isn't just a godmode toggle — it's a full-blown hack setup that reveals everything: where the ghost is, what its type is, what room it’s in, how to trigger hunts (or avoid them completely). Even better, you can freeze sanity, fly around, and mess with ghost behaviors. Perfect for solo plays, duo runs, or chaotic co-op lobbies 😈
